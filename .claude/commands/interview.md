# Spec Interview

Read the file at @SPEC.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. But make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file.

## Guidelines

- Ask probing, non-obvious questions that get at deeper design decisions
- Cover technical implementation details thoroughly
- Explore UI/UX considerations and user experience edge cases
- Discuss potential concerns, risks, and failure modes
- Examine tradeoffs between different approaches
- Don't ask questions that have obvious answers from reading the spec
- Keep interviewing until all aspects are thoroughly covered
- After the interview is complete, update the spec file with all gathered information
